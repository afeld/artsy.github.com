<p>Heroku will log an <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-codes#r10-boot-timeout">R10 - Boot Timeout</a> error when a web process takes longer than 60 seconds to bind to its assigned port. This error is often caused by a process being unable to reach an external resource, such as a database or because you have a lot of gems in your <code>Gemfile</code> which take a long time to load.</p>

<p><code>
Dec 12 12:12:12 prod heroku/web.1:
  Error R10 (Boot timeout)
  Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
</code></p>

<p>There's currently no way to increase this boot timeout, but we can beat it with a proxy implemented by our new <a href="https://github.com/dblock/heroku-forward">heroku-forward</a> gem.</p>

<p>The concepts for <code>heroku-forward</code> come from <a href="http://noverloop.be/beating-herokus-60s-boot-times-with-the-cedar-stack-and-a-reverse-proxy/">this article</a> by Nicolas Overloop. The basic idea is to have a proxy bind to the port immediately and then buffer requests until the backend came up. The proxy implementation is Ilya Grigorik's <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-proxy">em-proxy</a>. Communication between the proxy and the backend happens over a unix domain socket (a file), which needed a bit of work (see <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-proxy/pull/31">#31</a>), inspired by an excellent article, <a href="http://jgwmaxwell.com/fighting-the-unicorns-becoming-a-thin-wizard-on-heroku">Fighting the Unicorns: Becoming a Thin Wizard on Heroku</a> by JGW Maxwell. The <code>heroku-forward</code> gem connects all the dots.</p>

<p>Check out the gem's <a href="https://github.com/dblock/heroku-forward/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for how to set it up.</p>

<p>Here's the log output from an application that uses this gem. Notice that Heroku reports the state of <code>web.1</code> up after just 4 seconds, while the application takes 67 seconds to boot.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Knowing how well your API performs in real time is essential to any successful project. That's because you can't fix what you can't measure.</p>

<p>We use and heavily contribute to <a href="http://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a>, a Ruby API DSL. Grape is a Rack middleware and we have been reporting API performance data to <a href="http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a> with code from <a href="http://code.dblock.org/new-relic-performance-instrumentation-with-grape-api">my older blog post</a>.</p>

<p>It's time to improve the reporting implementation and address performance monitoring in both development and production environments. Here's what a single API request breakdown is going to look like.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/transaction-detail.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>NewRelic RPM</h2>

<p>The first step is to add the <code>newrelic_rpm</code> gem to Gemfile, which implements the actual realtime performance reporting to NewRelic. We also use <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid">Mongoid</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/moped">Moped</a> MongoDB Ruby driver, which can be instrumented with <code>newrelic_moped</code>.</p>

<p><code>ruby Gemfile
gem "newrelic_moped", "0.0.3"
gem "newrelic_rpm", "3.3.3"
</code></p>

<p>You will need <code>config/newrelic.yml</code> in your application. Ours can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170458">this gist</a> and works well both locally and on Heroku.</p>

<h2>Instrumenting Grape</h2>

<p>In the past we used <a href="https://gist.github.com/1233422">NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::API</a>, which works for any generic Rack middleware. This would report all API calls to NewRelic, but would treat requests to <em>/api/artist/andy-warhol</em> and <em>/api/artist/wassily-kandinsky</em> as unrelated. That is because the instrumenter is a Rack middleware that wraps Grape requests <em>before</em> they reach Grape. The only information available is the request URL, and not the actual API route that is going to be matched when the request is processed.</p>

<p>We want both requests to <em>/api/artist/andy-warhol</em> and <em>/api/artist/wassily-kandinsky</em> to be treated as <em>/api/artist/:id</em>. Lets insert a middleware inside Grape itself, once the URL has been matched to a route.</p>

<p><code>ruby api.rb
class API &lt;&lt; Grape::API
  use ApiNewRelicInstrumenter
  ...
end
</code></p>

<p>The new instrumenter has access to the current API endpoint via <code>env['api.endpoint']</code> and reports data via NewRelic's <code>ControllerInstrumentation</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby
class ApiNewRelicInstrumenter &lt; Grape::Middleware::Base
  include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation</p>

<p>  def call(env)</p>

<pre><code>trace_options = {
  category: :rack,
  path: env['api.endpoint'].routes.first.route_path,
  request: request,
  ...
}

perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(trace_options) do
  yield
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The complete code for <code>ApiNewRelicInstrumenter</code> can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170469">this gist</a>. It supports enabling and disabling performance reporting by setting <code>NEW_RELIC_ID</code> and works around NewRelic's method name limitations (these cannot contain slashes).</p>

<h2>Development Environment</h2>

<p>You can now see NewRelic performance data in development mode, too. If you mount Grape inside Rails run <code>NEW_RELIC_ID=foo rails s</code>. Navigate to <em>http://localhost:3000/newrelic</em> to see your local traces.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/developer-mode.png"></p>

<p>Drill into an individual request to find several detailed breakdowns of how time was spent, including specific MongoDB queries (under "SQL", naturally).</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/sql-detail.png"></p>

<p>NewRelic is a commercial product, but you can run development mode for free! Note that enabling this will triple your local Rails boot time: we enable development mode by setting <code>development_mode: &lt;%= !!ENV['NEW_RELIC_ID'] %&gt;</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170458">newrelic.rpm</a>.</p>
